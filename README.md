# Simple-MSI-Extractor
A very simple PS1 script that extracts MSI's.

# Notes
The output select dialog opens behind Powershell, I cant fix this without writing my own GUI, so this is the best you'll get.

# How to run

1) Download the MSI-extractor.ps1 file from the Releases tab. 
2) Right click on the file in Explorer, and select Run with Powershell. 
3) When it runs, you should see a Explorer window pop-up, select the MSI from there.
4) Click OK, and then select a output directory (use Create New Folder if you want it to be more organized when extracting)
